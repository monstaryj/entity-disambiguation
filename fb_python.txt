 i find these days that i'm much less patient with programming in overly complex frameworks.  if i want a simple server side process i write it in python (and `import web` if it needs to be accessed across a network), i tend to serve json from my web apps and push as much composition and functionality as i can into javascript.  my api documentation is mostly a series of `curl` commands with expected output.  the upside is i feel like i'm more boldly approaching software development the downside is i think i'm less hirable in a corporate environment.  i haven't collected enough data to know if that's a bad thingsmile emoticon

"it's a python," he said.
i did see someone with a python though! oh, and cats...
life saver!!  we found a python in our garage
they had a few bearded dragons*, some corn snakes and a couple of ball pythons.
great place good service and i buy my feeder rats for my ball python here.
i had not been in this store before but the ball python needed to move from mice to rats and they said they had them in stock.
just picked up this beautiful pastel female ball python shes a beaut for sure!
the snakes looked alright, but they had mostly burmese pythons and colubrids.
so i went in to purchase some ants which they didn't carry i ended up walking out with a golden knee and the next day a mojave ball python.
i will return to predators for all of my future business bc sometimes ball pythons don't eat and the rats need to be returned.
that isn't surprising, really, considering the massive python of a snaking line up
i brought my gorgeous green tree python to see dr. k on a matter of a stomach issue.
money hungry pythons!!!!
the highlight for me was being allowed to hold a ball python snake by one of the attendants,
i recently acquired a ball python and have been surprised at the lack of support i have with my family and friends.
the people are always super nice and understand my picky ball pythons demands for all white feeders.
they had a python at the time, too,
they have varied displays ranging from stuffed animals to mineral exhibits to live sharks and a pair of pythons to some interesting dinosaur animatrons.
bought a fire ball python...
they have exhibits of live animals like burmese pythons, tarantulas, scorpions and lizards.
they have freaking python filets for goodness sake.
i recently went to go buy a under tank heater for my ball python as hers had unexpectedly gone out and we needed one asap.
i have bought kangaroo, quail eggs, python, rabbit, boar, various caviars, skate wing, dragon beans, fruits from all over the world and so many more fun things. but for while now they have been carrying less and less of the things that made market district different than any regular giant eagle.
on fridays the"meats gone wild" guy is here: alligator, antelope, kangaroo, python, yak, boar.
i felt like a python when leaving.
we bought our ball python from this store right before they changed locations.
i had a tragic experience with a ball python i purchased else where...
