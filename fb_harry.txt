cariann higginbothamand i decided to take time out of our yearly walt disney world annual trip to hit universal studios orlando for the new harry potter stuff. all i can say is: wow!for us, we like disney parks because of the immersive theming. while we do some rides sometimes, really it is about the experience for us. that immersive and inspiring experience had been lacking at universal studios until the addition of harry potter.i truly feel teleported in to a new world....it is better than most anything disney parks has done and on par with or better than cars land. this may pose an issue for disney parks. to date they seem to be rehashing what they have always done in the past. no new transport systems. no new immersive experiences. just a bunch of new merchandising. don't get me wrong, disney parks are still the gold standard, but if universal keeps this up, i can easily see them taking the throne from the mouse!kudos universal.the one area both organizations can improve on is transit. both groups seem to forget that the experience starts before i am ever on property. how i get to parking, how i park and how i get to the themed worlds is all part of my experience. right now they all do it wrong. maybe universal will be the first to deploy something like prt or maglev rail? the moving sidewalks they have now are lame. this is an area begging to be fixed.see more
