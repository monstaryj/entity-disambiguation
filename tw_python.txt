having started working in ruby it seems crazy that python requires two different package managers (pip and easy_install) to be effective.
this book on learning python is from 2001, and its “hello, world!” example doesn’t work because ‘print’ was changed to a function.
rt@reed_mangino:  $ python <return> >>> import this <return>  re-read until memorized.

the#pythonstandard library has ~200k loc but defines only 165 exceptions.
just switched to@pycharmand now i'm gonna have nightmares about "python skeletons".
wait, the built-in python libraries don't do https certificate validation? they just silently accept anything? isn't that a little odd?
pycharm was already a super hero but now pycharm with java 1.8 is beautiful. so fast, much wow#python

php, css, javascript, sql, and html, of course! a plethora of frameworks, no problem! but god forbid you add python or go to that list.

my options are to use the dated 0.9 socket.io and python gevent-socket.io or suffer using node.js .. tough call :(
grrr python support for socket.io is pretty piss poor. i have an experimental project that would require it and node.js is a bit too painful
why does 'list' implement __iadd__ (+=)  in python? yeah, it's mutable, but += looks like an assignment - not a method call.
